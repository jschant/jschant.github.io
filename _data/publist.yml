- title: "Multi-Scale Self-Attention Network for Denoising Medical Images"
  image: apsipa_2024_2.png
  description: In this work, we develop a new deep learning-based image denoising especially to deal with rapid fluorescence and ultrasound captures where traditional noise mitigation strategies are limited, such as increasing pixel dwell time or frame averaging.
