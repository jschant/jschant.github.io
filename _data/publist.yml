  image: isbi_2024.png
  description: An off-the-shelf model for unsupervised domain adaptation (OSUDA) can be vulnerable to backdoor attacks due to the inability to access or control source domain data, but a proposed method quantifies backdoor sensitivity using a Lipschitz constant and eliminates the infection by overwriting backdoor-related channel kernels, validated on a multi-center cardiac dataset.
