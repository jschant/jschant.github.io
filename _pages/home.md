In the ever-evolving landscape of healthcare and technology, our endeavor is not merely to traverse the burgeoning chasm that traditionally separates the domains of engineering and medical science but to construct a robust bridge that unites them. At the heart of our mission lies a profound commitment to leveraging the cutting-edge advancements in imaging and analysis, augmented significantly by the transformative power of machine learning. Our fascination doesn't stop at the mere application of these technologies; it extends into the realm of computer vision and the intricate layers of both machine and deep learning techniques.

We find ourselves at a unique crossroads, driven by the potential to revolutionize the way clinical problems are approached and solved. Our focus is not generalized but sharply tailored towards tackling a spectrum of challenging clinical quandaries. Each project we undertake is a step forward in this grand fusion of disciplines, embodying our aspiration to bring about a new era in medical diagnostics and treatment. This pursuit is not just about technological innovation; it's about shaping a future where the boundaries of what is medically possible are expanded through the seamless integration of engineering brilliance with medical insight.

We are a dynamic research group, located at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, home to the largest hospital-based imaging research program in the US. 

We are grateful for funding from NIH and industry partners.

**We are  looking for passionate new Postdocs, PhD students, or Master students to join the team!**
